# Pondering paths

## Position yet elsewhere
To run the /challenge/run program in a specific path

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y7RA3MncztjYsIHyiu5IJVBS6h5.QX4QTN0wiNwIzNzEzW}`

first entered /challenge/run, then it showed that I'm not in the /usr/share/doc  directory. So that is the path where I'm supposed to run the /challenge/run program.

```bash
/challenge/run
 cd /usr/share/doc
/challenge/run
```
