### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sijbnJEW0Sd4MinN0wZbTd3ljTr.QX1QDO0wiNwIzNzEzW}`

Ran the /challenge/run which ran a process, suspended the process and ran the same process again as a copy. Got a flag.

```bash
/challenge/run
# pressed ctrl z and suspended the process
/challenge/run
pwn.college{sijbnJEW0Sd4MinN0wZbTd3ljTr.QX1QDO0wiNwIzNzEzW}
```
