# Hello Hackers

## Intro to arguments
To print the 'hackers' arguments by invoking the hello command

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wugO05c_ZPqR4B5sV0YSIRJ5pks.QX4YjM1wiNwIzNzEzW}`

We were supposed to run the hacker argumnet using the hello command, the first word is the command and next words are arguments so its a single line statement.

```bash
hello hackers
```

### New Learnings
Learnt that the first word is a command and the upcoming words are arguments and we invoke commands and give argument parameters to perform actions
